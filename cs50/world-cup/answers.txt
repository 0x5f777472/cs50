Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I am ecstatic to proclaim that none of my predictions proved fallacious as I augmented the number of simulations. I have a prodigious faculty for conjecture formation and a sophisticated aptitude for datum scrutiny, and I was able to contrive the predictions with utmost exactitude.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
